In my dream

I was working for a computer company, Hamish was also there
And there was a seminar or classroom
where we talked about enlightenment
and I said there is little of that
in my life and if so it seemed accidental
and a woman said something hard to understand
about being a brave hero for her
and I felt like I had to sing
and felt like it was expressing the moment
but nobody expressed that they were impressed
and I wondered if I had lost my voice
or never had one

I know my voice is strong and carries
It is deep and can be calm
But I don't know many who listen to me
and I wonder why that is

I don't want to speak functionally
and share techniques I learned
for playing a role in the tech biz

My life is full of superficial habits
Meals, uninspired, just get them done
and keep it somewhat healthy
clothes, 2nd hand, don't want cotton
get to school and work on time
do the 3 things in the morning: brush, dress, eat
Why do we do have to go there?
Kids: To be supervised and learn something (read, write, etc)
Parents: To go to work and earn money
To earn money we have to be functional for a paid job
Why do we need money?
Because we have material needs and stuff costs money
Especially if it doesn't grow on trees in the wild
Houses, cars, household machines, clothes,
Ready-to-prepare, easy-to-find food items
Electricity (tu run devices),
insurance (for secondary money problems)
Clean and safe drinking Water
Good reliable dry bedding

And why does it all cost money?
And why don't we live "off the land"?

All that stuff costs money
because it had to be made by other people
and machines and so on that also had to be made
and stuff had to be prepared or extracted from nature
So workers and work had to be paid
and owners had to be paid for using their stuff
and profiteers had to profit
Or they would not have made capital available

So why is this text called "habitual enlightenment"?
Enlightenment was sparse in my dream
and is sparse in my life
I feel I need some enlightenment
to actually understand what I am doing
and what we as humans are doing and why
and how nature works and the world
not just physically and scientifically
but what we live for and what is worth
living for

Enlightenment would be the light in the dark
of depression and routine activity

Is the temple my own body and mind?
I have to start somewhere and I cannot "change the world"
or other people, often cannot even reach my kids

If the spirit is in me
With enlightenment, beauty and fulfilling purpose
Then why do I feel it so rarely?

And that's where habit comes in
I think my habits cover and hide
what I would call enlightenment

The habits are there to survive economically
in this industrialized "modern" world
to function in the economy
and fit in with social norms

And the built world, our houses and streets
don't leave much room for adventure

And when nature is cold, wet and rocky
why would we venture out
so we stay and gravitate to the home
where we engage in habitual things

And I feel like I need more enlightenment
and share more enlightenment with my family

And by enlightenment I do not mean just a rational mind
and thoughts from rational philosophers from that epoch

I also mean inspiration through beauty
apparent meaning, understanding and belonging
and also excitement with that

How can I bring that into my life more?
Would it be lots of extra work?

When currently, the functional routines
and the keeping intact of house and stuff
take up the major part of my time

Where is the intersection of required or acquired habits
with inspiration and feel-good-mood?

Let's try itemized sets and intersect them:

Some habits
- Running (jogging)
- Eat chocolate, drink coffee
- Write poetry that comes to mind
- Consume internet news
- Read books (fiction, IT, politics)
- Find and listen to alternative / wave / rock
- Recreational non-competitive soccer
- Think about how society and humans are
- Think about how society and humans should be
- Think about how change can be (not) affected
- Worry and despair about reality
- Dislike the habits and the functional musts
- Don't feel energetic enough to make other news

Things I enjoy or even find inspiring, enlightening:
- Running (including the feeling afterwards)
- Write poetry that comes to mind
- Read certain books (not everything)
- Find and listen to good music
- Recreational non-competitive soccer
- Gardening(?)
- Summer on the beach
- Bouncing around in the not too cold ocean
- Cycling through nature
- Camping (in the summer)
- Relax in the sun (not too hot)
- Sauna or hot tub

Things I want to try or do more
- Explore my voice (speech and singing)
- Meditation
- Yoga or stretching exercises
- Sewing my own clothes from good fabric
- Swim
- Vegetarian food (flavorful healthy recipes)
- Fasting(?)
