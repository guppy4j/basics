How to form an Organization

See "Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks"
also see "Legal Information Society of Nova Scotia"

What is required:
- Name
- Purpose statement
- Annual fee
- ...
- Simple core rules ("by-laws")

DO NOT form organizations!
=> Create _communities_ instead
- a group of _people_ who do stuff
- trust-based 
- simple core rules
- no-one gets paid
- influence: equality or merit (?)
- "revenue" is split equally (?)

Avoid legal crap (getting sued, etc)  
- let everyone sign waivers wherever possible
- do NOT spend money on insurance
