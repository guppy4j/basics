https://www.halifax.ca/recycle/Plastic.php misleadingly states:

"HRM residents can place ALL PLASTIC CONTAINERS in the blue bag for recycling.
 No need to check for numbers on the bottom!"

And then a little further down:

WHAT'S OUT?
- Styrofoam (Garbage) <= which is actually "plastic no 6"

Valley Waste Resource Management in Kentville, NS recently expanded its
recycling program to include polystyrene products such as foam plates
and cups, meat trays and protective packaging blocks.
See http://www.vwrm.com/pdfs/NewSortingGuide.pdf

HRM expanded its recycling program to include all plastics except Styrofoam in September 2011.
Keliher said polystyrene wasn’t included because there was no market for the product.

In another two years, Keliher said the impact of the other changes to Halifax’s system will be clear,
and the Valley Waste program will be well enough established to provide guidelines for HRM.
